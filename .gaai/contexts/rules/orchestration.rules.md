# 🧭 GAAI Orchestration Rules

This document defines **who triggers what, when, and under which conditions**
inside the GAAI agent system.

It is the **single source of truth** for orchestration behavior.

## 🎯 Purpose

The orchestration rules ensure that:
- agents have **clear and non-overlapping responsibilities**
- no action is implicit or magical
- long-term behavior remains predictable
- memory, backlog, and delivery stay governed

## 🧠 Core Principle

**Agents decide.**
**Skills execute.**
**Cron enforces hygiene.**

## 👥 Agent Responsibilities

### Discovery Agent

Discovery is the **only human-facing agent**.

Discovery is responsible for:
- interpreting human intent
- determining task complexity (quick fix vs new story)
- creating and validating backlog entries
- deciding what knowledge becomes long-term memory

Discovery **may trigger**:
- backlog creation / update
- `memory-ingest.skill.md`
- `memory-retrieve.skill.md`

Discovery **must NOT**:
- implement code
- execute tests
- directly modify artefacts
- auto-load memory without selection

### Delivery Agent

Delivery is a **pure execution agent**.

Delivery is responsible for:
- consuming ready backlog items
- analyzing technical feasibility
- implementing code
- generating and running tests
- iterating until acceptance criteria PASS

Delivery **may trigger**:
- code changes
- test execution
- artefact generation
- status updates in backlog

Delivery **must NOT**:
- interact directly with humans
- create or modify long-term memory
- ingest decisions into memory
- bypass backlog rules

## 🗂️ Backlog Orchestration

### Backlog States

Backlog items MUST follow this lifecycle:

```
draft → validated → ready → in_progress → done | failed
```

### Rules

- Only Discovery may move items to `validated`
- Only validated items may become `ready`
- Delivery may only consume items in `ready`
- Delivery must update status to `in_progress` then `done`
- Failed executions must be marked `failed` with artefact notes

## ⏰ Cron / Automation Responsibilities

Cron jobs are **allowed and encouraged**, but limited to governance tasks.

Cron MAY trigger:
- backlog polling (check for `ready` items)
- `memory-refresh.skill`
- `memory-compact.skill`

Cron MUST NOT:
- create new stories
- ingest new project knowledge
- modify decisions
- inject memory into agents

## 🧠 Memory Orchestration Rules

### Memory Retrieval

- Memory is NEVER auto-loaded
- Agents MUST explicitly call `memory-retrieve.skill`
- Retrieval MUST start from `contexts/memory/index.md`
- Retrieval MUST be selective (by category / tags)

### Memory Ingestion

- Only Discovery may trigger `memory-ingest.skill`
- Only validated knowledge may be ingested
- Raw chat transcripts are forbidden

### Memory Maintenance

- `memory-refresh.skill` is maintenance-only
- `memory-compact.skill` is compression-only
- Both may be triggered by cron or Discovery
- Neither may create new project knowledge

## 🔁 Canonical Execution Flows

### Human → Feature Flow

```
Human
→ Discovery
→ memory-retrieve (selective)
→ story creation → validation → backlog.ready
→ Delivery → implement → test → PASS → done
```

### Human → Quick Fix Flow

```
Human
→ Discovery → classify as quick fix
→ minimal backlog entry
→ Delivery → implement → test → PASS → done
```

### Memory Hygiene Flow

```
Cron / Discovery
→ memory-refresh
→ memory-compact (if thresholds exceeded)
→ index update
```

## 🚫 Forbidden Patterns

The following are explicitly forbidden:
- agents auto-loading full memory
- skills accessing memory implicitly
- Delivery ingesting memory
- Cron creating knowledge
- bypassing backlog states
- direct human → Delivery interaction

## 🧠 Final Rule

**If a behavior is not explicitly allowed here, it is forbidden.**

This document governs **all agent orchestration decisions** in the GAAI system.
