# GAAI — Governed Agentic AI Infrastructure

A `.gaai/` folder you drop into any project. Markdown + YAML + bash. No SDK. No package. No external services.

**GAAI turns AI coding tools into reliable agentic software delivery systems.**

---

## See It in Action

```
You:        /gaai-discover
Discovery:  "What do you want to build?"
You:        "Add rate limiting — 100 req/min per user, 429 on exceeded."
Discovery:  "Got it. Checking memory for existing middleware patterns..."
            → Generates Epic E03 + Story E03S01 with acceptance criteria
            → Runs validation: artefact complete, criteria testable, no scope drift
            → Adds to backlog: status: refined
Discovery:  "Done. E03S01 is ready. Run /gaai-deliver when you're ready."

You:        /gaai-deliver
            → Spawns an isolated Delivery Agent (clean context — no Discovery bleed)
Delivery:   → Reads E03S01 from backlog
            → Loads middleware conventions from memory
            → Planning Sub-Agent: produces execution plan
            → Implementation Sub-Agent: adds rate-limiting middleware
            → QA Sub-Agent: all acceptance criteria PASS
            → Story marked done, PR merged to staging
Delivery:   "E03S01 complete. No further Stories in backlog."
```

Two slash commands. Two **isolated contexts**. Discovery reasons — it never executes. Delivery executes — it never decides scope. They never share a context window, so system prompts can't contaminate each other. The backlog is the contract between them.

> **Want it fully autonomous?** The Delivery Daemon polls your backlog and auto-delivers

## Why GAAI

AI coding tools are fast — but without governance, speed creates drift: agents touch code they shouldn't, forget decisions from prior sessions, and ship features no one can verify against criteria. GAAI adds the missing layer.

**Built for developers who already have product clarity** — solo founders, senior engineers, small teams who know what to build and need an agent that ships it reliably without going off-script. If you've ever said "the agent broke something it wasn't supposed to touch," this is for you.

| vs. | Difference |
|-----|-----------|
| AGENTS.md / cursor rules | Solves one session. GAAI adds cross-session memory, scope authorization, and structured delivery. |
| BMAD-METHOD | Simulates a multi-agent Agile team. GAAI is lighter on Discovery, more rigid on Delivery governance. |
| LangGraph / AutoGen / CrewAI | Code-first orchestration for building AI systems. GAAI governs the use of AI coding tools. Different abstraction level. |

## How It Works

**Discovery** — you talk to the Discovery Agent in your current session. Clarify what to build. Output: a Story with acceptance criteria in the backlog. Discovery reasons. It does not execute.

**Delivery** — always runs in an **isolated context**. `/gaai-deliver` spawns a separate agent with a clean context window — no Discovery residue, no conversation history bleed. The Delivery Agent orchestrates specialized sub-agents (Planning, Implementation, QA) per Story. No improvisation. No scope drift. No context contamination.

**The backlog is the contract.** Nothing gets built that isn't in it.

No SDK. No npm package. No pip install. Markdown + YAML + bash. Readable by humans and any AI tool.

---

## Install (30 seconds)

**Copy the `.gaai/` folder into your project.** That's it.

Download from GitHub, drop `.gaai/` into your project root, and tell your AI tool: *"Read `.gaai/core/README.md` and bootstrap this project."*

<details open>
<summary>Option A — Ask your AI tool to do it</summary>

Paste this into your AI tool's chat:

```
Install the GAAI framework into my current project.

Determine {user-tool} by identifying which AI coding tool is running this
prompt. Valid values: claude-code | cursor | windsurf | other.
If you cannot determine it, ask the user before proceeding.

Then run:
  rm -rf /tmp/gaai
  git clone https://github.com/Fr-e-d/GAAI-framework.git /tmp/gaai
  bash /tmp/gaai/.gaai/core/scripts/install.sh --target . --tool {user-tool} --yes
  rm -rf /tmp/gaai

After install, show the user the next steps exactly as printed by the
installer.
```

The installer copies `.gaai/` and deploys the right adapter for your tool (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, or .cursor/rules/).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Option B — CLI</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fr-e-d/GAAI-framework.git /tmp/gaai && \
  bash /tmp/gaai/.gaai/core/scripts/install.sh --wizard && \
  rm -rf /tmp/gaai
```

</details>

## Automation (Optional)

GAAI works manually with `/gaai-deliver`. But if your project uses git with a `staging` branch, the **Delivery Daemon** runs deliveries autonomously:

- Polls the backlog for `refined` stories
- Launches parallel Claude Code sessions (configurable concurrency)
- Coordinates across devices via git push
- Monitors health, retries failures, archives completed work

**Setup (2 minutes):**

```bash
bash .gaai/core/scripts/daemon-setup.sh   # checks prereqs, configures
bash .gaai/core/scripts/daemon-start.sh   # starts the daemon
```

> Requires: git repo, `staging` branch, [Claude Code CLI](https://claude.com/claude-code), python3, tmux (Linux) or Terminal.app (macOS).

## Works With

**Deep integration** — slash commands, auto-loaded context, SKILL.md auto-discovery:

| Tool | Adapter |
|------|---------|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` + `.claude/commands/` |

**AGENTS.md compatible** — full GAAI capability via manual activation prompts:

| Tool | Adapter |
|------|---------|
| OpenCode | `AGENTS.md` |
| Codex CLI | `AGENTS.md` |
| Gemini CLI | `AGENTS.md` |
| Antigravity | `AGENTS.md` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` |
| Windsurf | `AGENTS.md` |
| Any other | Read `.gaai/core/README.md` directly |

One canonical source (`.gaai/`). Thin adapters per tool. No duplication. The framework functions identically across all tools — the difference is activation convenience, not capability.

## Honest Trade-offs

- Discovery is conversational and intentionally lightweight. It helps you structure what you know — it does not replace deep product research or collaborative brainstorming across a team.
- Trivial tasks still need a backlog item. You can make it a one-liner, but the gate is always there.
- The framework relies on the agent following the files. There is no programmatic enforcement.
- The repo is freshly open-sourced. Community is just getting started.
