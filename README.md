# GAAI — Governed Agentic AI Infrastructure

A `.gaai/` folder you drop into any project. Markdown + YAML + bash. No SDK. No package. No external services.

**GAAI turns AI coding tools into reliable agentic software delivery systems.**

## See It in Action

```
You:        /gaai-discover
Discovery:  "What do you want to build?"
You:        "Add rate limiting — 100 req/min per user, 429 on exceeded."
Discovery:  "Got it. Checking memory for existing middleware patterns..."
            → Generates Epic E03 + Story E03S01 with acceptance criteria
            → Runs validation: artefact complete, criteria testable, no scope drift
            → Adds to backlog: status: refined
Discovery:  "Done. E03S01 is ready. Run /gaai-deliver when you're ready."

You:        /gaai-deliver
Delivery:   → Reads E03S01 from backlog
            → Loads middleware conventions from memory
            → Planning Sub-Agent: produces execution plan
            → Implementation Sub-Agent: adds rate-limiting middleware
            → QA Sub-Agent: all acceptance criteria PASS
            → Story marked done, archived
Delivery:   "E03S01 complete. No further Stories in backlog."
```

Two slash commands. Discovery reasons — it never executes. Delivery executes — it never decides scope. The backlog is the contract between them.

> **Want it fully autonomous?** The Delivery Daemon polls your backlog and auto-delivers
> stories in parallel — no human in the loop. [See Automation →](#automation-optional)

## Install (30 seconds)

**Copy the `.gaai/` folder into your project.** That's it.

Download from GitHub, drop `.gaai/` into your project root, and tell your AI tool: *"Read `.gaai/core/README.md` and bootstrap this project."*

<details open>
<summary>Option A — Ask your AI tool to do it</summary>

Paste this into your AI tool's chat:

```
Install the GAAI framework into my current project.

Determine {user-tool} by identifying which AI coding tool is running this
prompt. Valid values: claude-code | cursor | windsurf | other.
If you cannot determine it, ask the user before proceeding.

Then run:
  rm -rf /tmp/gaai
  git clone https://github.com/Fr-e-d/GAAI-framework.git /tmp/gaai
  bash /tmp/gaai/.gaai/core/scripts/install.sh --target . --tool {user-tool} --yes
  rm -rf /tmp/gaai

After install, show the user the next steps exactly as printed by the
installer.
```

The installer copies `.gaai/` and deploys the right adapter for your tool (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, or .cursor/rules/).

<summary>Option B — CLI</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fr-e-d/GAAI-framework.git /tmp/gaai && \
  bash /tmp/gaai/.gaai/core/scripts/install.sh --wizard && \
  rm -rf /tmp/gaai
```

## The Problem It Solves

Your AI coding tool writes code fast. But without a governance layer, speed creates drift:

- The agent ships the feature — and quietly refactors two unrelated modules you didn't mention
- You agreed three sessions ago: no ORM, raw SQL only. The agent just introduced an ORM dependency — it had no memory of that decision
- Acceptance criteria were written after implementation. No one can verify the agent built the right thing
- A critical bug appears. You open a new session. The agent has no idea what the system does or what was decided last week
- You're not sure what the agent touched or what it was allowed to touch. There's no record either way

None of these are bugs in the AI. They are symptoms of using a powerful execution engine without a governance layer.

---

## How It Works

**Discovery** — you talk to the Discovery Agent. Clarify what to build. Output: a Story with acceptance criteria in the backlog. Discovery reasons. It does not execute.

**Delivery** — autonomous execution. The Delivery Agent orchestrates specialized sub-agents (Planning, Implementation, QA) per Story. No improvisation. No scope drift.

**The backlog is the contract.** Nothing gets built that isn't in it.

```

No SDK. No npm package. No pip install. Markdown + YAML + bash. Readable by humans and any AI tool.

## Automation (Optional)

GAAI works manually with `/gaai-deliver`. But if your project uses git with a `staging` branch, the **Delivery Daemon** runs deliveries autonomously:

- Polls the backlog for `refined` stories
- Launches parallel Claude Code sessions (configurable concurrency)
- Coordinates across devices via git push
- Monitors health, retries failures, archives completed work

**Setup (2 minutes):**

```bash
bash .gaai/core/scripts/daemon-setup.sh   # checks prereqs, configures
bash .gaai/core/scripts/daemon-start.sh   # starts the daemon
```

> Requires: git repo, `staging` branch, [Claude Code CLI](https://claude.com/claude-code), python3, tmux (Linux) or Terminal.app (macOS).

## Works With

**Deep integration** — slash commands, auto-loaded context, SKILL.md auto-discovery:

| Tool | Adapter |
|------|---------|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` + `.claude/commands/` |

**AGENTS.md compatible** — full GAAI capability via manual activation prompts:

| Tool | Adapter |
|------|---------|
| OpenCode | `AGENTS.md` |
| Codex CLI | `AGENTS.md` |
| Gemini CLI | `AGENTS.md` |
| Antigravity | `AGENTS.md` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` |
| Windsurf | `AGENTS.md` |
| Any other | Read `.gaai/core/README.md` directly |

One canonical source (`.gaai/`). Thin adapters per tool. No duplication. The framework functions identically across all tools — the difference is activation convenience, not capability.
