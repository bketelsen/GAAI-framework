# Contributing to GAAI

## This is a "Fork & Own" Framework

GAAI is not a library you contribute skills or features to. It is a **design pattern expressed in files** — a starting point you fork, clone, and adapt to your own project.

**The right way to use GAAI:**
1. Fork or clone this repo
2. Copy `.gaai/` into your project with `.gaai/core/scripts/install.sh`
3. Adapt the rules, memory, and skills to your project's needs
4. The fork is yours — you own it

**There is no upstream to contribute to** for new skills, new agents, or new rules. Those belong in your fork.

## What You Can Contribute

Bug reports and documentation fixes are welcome.

### Bug Reports

Found something wrong in the framework files — a broken script, an incorrect reference, a malformed YAML template? Open an issue using the [bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).

### Documentation Fixes

Typos, unclear wording, broken links in `docs/` or `.gaai/**/*.md`? Open a PR with your fix. Keep it minimal.

### What We Do NOT Accept

- New skills (add them to your own fork)
- New agents (add them to your own fork)
- New rule files (add them to your own fork)
- Refactoring of existing content
- Opinionated changes to philosophy or approach

## Working on This Repo

If you're fixing bugs or improving docs, keep these constraints in mind:

- **Never break `.gaai/` integrity.** The health check (`core/scripts/health-check.sh`) must always pass.
- **Never rename skill directories.** Skill directory names are referenced in agent files.
- **Never rename rule files.** Rule filenames are referenced in agents and compat adapters.
- **Keep compat adapters thin.** Files in `core/compat/` must reference canonical files — never duplicate content.
